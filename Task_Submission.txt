Hi, I'm Flavia from Italy, I studied Energy Engineering and I've living in Switzerland for 4 years now. 
I currently working as simulation engineer for a company in Basel and in the last year I started becoming
more and more interested in Data Science and Machine Learning.
I took an introductory course on ML on Coursera, started networking with external and decided that I want 
to deepen my knowledge in this field.

At the end of this programm I hope to end up with a overview on Data Science and ML topics 
in order to finally change carrer path and find a job in this field!
